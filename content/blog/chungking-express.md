## By Wong Kar-Wai, 1994

This is one of Quentin Tarantino's favourites movies, and it's the beginning of a decade of great movies by Wong Kar-Wai and his partnership with the cinematographer Christopher Doyle. I didn't love the movie as much as he did, but I understand his point, this is a movie you like if you like film on itself, don't watch it for his story or stars. This movie actually has two stories, but what happens to the characters is not really the point, the movie is about their journeys, not their destinations.

The film starts with a policeman who is lonely and depressed, after a woman that left him. He uses the expiration dates on cans of pineapple, as that's what she loved, as a way of doing a countdown to find another woman, the 30 days. He manages to find a new woman, and as we expect their relationship to evolve, the film introduces us to a new story, a new couple. A waitress falls in love with a cop. She gets the keys to his appartment, moving in when he's not there, subtly rearranging it in an attempt to cheer him up.

These are stories about disconnections, loneliness in a vast city, an explosion of colour and a rush of blurred motion that captures the mood and the fast-paced city of Hong Kong. Chungking Express is an exploration of how human relationships are affected by time and space, and a great introduction to Wong Kar-Wai's movie style.
